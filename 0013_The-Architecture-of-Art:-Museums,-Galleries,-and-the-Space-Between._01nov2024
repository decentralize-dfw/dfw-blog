Why do art spaces exist in the first place? Maybe to store our masterpieces, or exhibit creativity, or make some money, or just give us a place to experience something beyond our daily lives. Could be all of these, really. From local galleries to grand museums, these spaces have become more than just walls holding art – they're where we go to feel something different. Sure, sometimes it's about checking out that famous painting everyone talks about, but it's also about how the whole place makes you feel, how you move through it, how time slows down a bit when you're there. Whether you're a regular gallery-hopper or someone who wanders in during lunch break, this is about exploring what these spaces mean to us. We'll look at how they work, why they matter, and what happens when we step inside – from the quiet museum halls to those pristine galleries and even into the digital future.


MUSEUM


Museums are an adventure from the moment you set out. Maybe you're taking two buses, navigating that awkward transfer between routes, watching the minutes tick by as you wonder if you'll make your connection. Or you're driving, circling the parking lot like a lost soul, each loop bringing a mix of hope and frustration until you finally spot that one car backing out. Perhaps you're in one of those cities where everything's within a ten-minute walk, passing by an old square that fills you with a quiet sense of importance, as though the museum itself is a living relic drawing you in, its presence growing stronger with each step.


The approach to the entrance has its own choreography – there's the coat drop at the cloakroom, where you fumble with your ticket while trying to manage your scarf and bag, the patient wait in line where you study the posters of upcoming exhibitions, and the security scan at the entrance where you perfect the art of emptying your pockets with practiced efficiency. You might squeeze in a smoke outside, knowing it'll be a while until the next one, watching other visitors stream past with their guidebooks and cameras at the ready.


Inside, museums have a distinctive architectural language – open, clean spaces with walls so pristinely blank they seem to dissolve into the background. Everything is arranged with meticulous precision to let the art command attention, each piece given its own breathing space, almost floating in three dimensions within its carefully measured territory. The building itself might be a bold architectural statement, an eye-catching structure that breaks up the city's rhythm with dramatic angles and unexpected materials, or it might blend quietly into the urban landscape, hiding in plain sight until you find yourself at its doors, surprised by the transition from street to sanctuary.


Staff become part of the museum's living architecture. You'll spot someone in a crisp white shirt and perfectly pressed black suit, strolling with that particular kind of practiced indifference that comes from years of balancing vigilance with discretion. They might pause near a valuable piece, adjusting their stance ever so slightly as someone approaches with a water bottle, or drift past a group taking photos, keeping watch without seeming too involved. They're the guardians of these quiet spaces, moving through their low-energy loops with the precision of planets in orbit.


The museum's soundscape weaves its own subtle symphony. Someone's audio guide crackles nearby, dropping a mismatched fact about Renaissance techniques while you're studying a modern installation, yet somehow it makes perfect sense. A tour guide's voice drifts over in a language you can't quite place, leading a group of older visitors wearing those distinctive oversized headphones, all nodding in synchronized understanding. It's oddly comforting, this babel of artistic appreciation, like every museum tour you've ever encountered condensed into a single moment.


Even in crowds, there's a peculiar hush – a soft murmur of whispered observations and careful footsteps that creates its own rhythm. The smell of the space tells its own story – that distinctive mix of old wood, fresh paint, and climate-controlled air that's especially sharp near the contemporary wing, where new installations leave their own temporary signatures. Your footsteps become part of the experience, echoing loudly on marble floors before being swallowed by carpet, each surface change marking a transition between artistic epochs.


Throughout the space, those little wooden stools appear like minimalist sculptures, tucked into corners or positioned near particularly demanding works. Sometimes museum staff perch on them, becoming living installations themselves, part of the careful balance between art and observation. The museum café emerges like an oasis, a place where you can grab an overpriced coffee and sit with friends, dissecting everything you've seen, hoping the espresso might somehow clarify your thoughts on abstract expressionism and conceptual installations.


You'll always spot the dedicated observers – maybe an older lady in a striking purple sweater, or someone with architecturally interesting glasses, who's been sitting on those painfully uncomfortable backless stools for what seems like hours, completely absorbed by a single piece. They're seeing something that others might miss, finding entire worlds in a single brush stroke or the curve of a sculpture.


The human choreography continues with photographers, both casual and serious, performing their careful dance around famous pieces. Friends help each other capture the perfect angle, leaning in close to document tiny details, while others attempt the perfect selfie with a masterpiece. Guards shift almost imperceptibly when someone edges too close, ready to maintain that invisible boundary between appreciation and preservation.


Some visitors study the descriptive plaques with scholarly intensity, spending more time reading about the art than looking at it, while others drift through the spaces like casual flâneurs, letting the art wash over them in waves. The lighting plays its part in this dance – sometimes harsh and reflective, forcing you to dodge your own shadow, other times falling with perfect natural grace across centuries-old canvases.


These spaces are more than collections of art – they're stages where human nature performs alongside the exhibitions, where every visit reveals new patterns in how we move through curated space, how we react to beauty and history, and how we share these experiences with others. From the familiar frustrations to the moments of unexpected joy, museums offer a constantly changing exhibition of humanity itself.



GALLERY

You know those pristine white spaces you pass on your way to work? The ones that always look empty but are somehow open for business? That’s your typical gallery, sitting there between the coffee shop and the boutique, looking like it landed from another planet where dust doesn’t exist. The name on the window is always in that clean-cut font—Helvetica, if you’re curious—spaced just so, making even the simplest word look like it should cost money to pronounce.


Getting in is the first adventure. You stand there, hand on the door, wondering if you’re actually allowed to enter. It’s like there’s an invisible force field of sophistication that makes everyone hesitate for that split second. Is it open? The hours say yes, but the emptiness inside whispers, “maybe not.” When you finally push that door open, the silence envelops you—not the comfortable quiet of a library, but a stillness that amplifies your own breathing.


Inside, you’ll spot the gallery’s gatekeeper, usually stationed behind a desk that looks more like a minimalist sculpture than a workspace. They’re often young, dressed in black so perfectly pressed you wonder if they iron their clothes while wearing them. A sleek computer screen glows in front of them, and they seem to exist in a state of deep absorption, yet their gaze is subtly aware of your every movement.


The funny thing about galleries is how they make ordinary things seem suspicious. That chair in the corner? It could be a place to rest or a priceless meditation on the nature of sitting—who knows? Even the thermostat on the wall acquires significance when it’s mounted at the same height as the artworks. You find yourself squinting at it, contemplating whether someone paid good money for what’s merely climate control.


The space plays tricks on you, too. These rooms, which appear too small for a sofa, somehow house massive sculptures. It’s as if they’ve mastered some secret art of spatial manipulation, making you question basic physics. The walls are so white they seem to erase themselves, leaving the art suspended in a strange liminal space where time feels slightly bent.


As you meander, you notice the subtle indicators of gallery life: pristine stacks of artist statements written in jargon so dense it makes your head spin, resting untouched like sacred texts. Price lists angle just so on the desk, playing hard to get while secretly hoping you’ll inquire.


Then there are the red dots—my favorite part. They appear next to certain pieces like tiny stamps of approval, instantly transforming your perception. It’s akin to when someone gets engaged; nothing’s actually changed about the artwork, but everyone suddenly looks at it differently.


People-watching is where the gallery experience gets really interesting. A visitor walks in clutching a coffee cup, and you can feel the gallery hold its breath, as if someone just brought a lit match into a room full of butterflies. VIP moments are equally telling; when someone important enters, often accompanied by a meticulously groomed dog, the staff’s demeanor shifts imperceptibly, like gravity has increased ever so slightly.


Opening nights reveal the gallery’s true colors. The usual tomb-like silence gives way to a buzz of conversation, with attendees clustering into groups, drinks in hand as if they’re props in an elaborate performance. Everyone seems to know each other—or at least pretends to—creating invisible force fields of dialogue that you must navigate like a social maze.


The drinks tell their own story, with each city sporting its signature gallery beverage: Milan does prosecco, Luxembourg pours crémant, and Istanbul serves red wine. The hierarchy becomes apparent in how these drinks are served—some get proper glasses, while others receive plastic cups. The difference is subtle yet palpable, and everyone pretends not to notice this quiet stratification.

Taking photos is a game of stealth. Pull out your phone, and suddenly a staff member materializes beside you, summoned by the mere suggestion of a camera. They speak the gallery’s dialect with finesse, making “please don’t touch that” sound like poetry in six different languages.


If you dare to ask about prices, you’ll encounter the gallery’s favorite phrase: “I’ll have to check with the director.” The director is often right there, pretending to be engrossed in their phone while keenly observing the unfolding scene.


The gallery's maintenance process is almost ceremonial. Between shows, the staff repaints those pristine walls with the dedication of someone restoring the Sistine Chapel. Spotlights are adjusted as if prepping for a space shuttle launch, and an ambient soundtrack floats just below the threshold of consciousness—enough to make silence seem noisy.


But here’s the thing about galleries: despite their quirks and unwritten rules, they’re actually fascinating places. They operate like small theaters where art, commerce, and social performance converge in an intricate dance. Whether you feel like an insider or an outsider, there’s something captivating about these spaces. They invite you not only to observe the art but also to reflect on how we all act around it. And maybe that’s the real show after all.



PRETENSE

Let's face it – art spaces are weird little pockets of alternate reality where time moves differently and everyone suddenly becomes very conscious of their footsteps. But they're also these incredible portals where you can spend an afternoon traveling through someone else's imagination without leaving a single room. What makes them special isn't just the art hanging on walls or lurking in corners – it's this whole ecosystem of unspoken rules, shared experiences, and those moments when you catch yourself thinking profound thoughts about a pile of rocks someone arranged just so.


These spaces work because they're built on this delicate balance of contradiction. They're public but somehow feel intimate, silent but full of whispered conversations, and technically free to enter (usually) but somehow make you feel like you should have dressed better. The architecture does this clever trick where it manages to be both invisible and impossible to ignore – like those fancy restaurants where the design is so minimal it loops back around to being maximalist. The lighting is always perfect, which sounds great until you realize it's perfect for the art, not for your selfie game.


What really makes these places tick is how they've mastered the art of making you hyper-aware of everything while simultaneously creating an environment where you can completely lose yourself. It's like they've figured out how to bottle contemplation and serve it in rooms. The temperature is always slightly cool, keeping you alert but not uncomfortable, and there's this persistent sense that you're part of something bigger than your Instagram feed – even if you're just pretending to understand why someone painted an entire canvas blue.


But let's talk about the elephant in the white cube – these spaces have issues that we all politely pretend not to notice, like that weird uncle at family gatherings. First off, there's this invisible force field of intimidation that makes perfectly normal people suddenly question if they're cultured enough to have opinions about art. It's like these spaces accidentally invented a new form of social anxiety where you worry about thinking wrong thoughts about the right art.


Then there's the whole performance aspect of it all. Everyone's trying so hard to look like they're not trying at all, walking around with this studied nonchalance that probably takes years to perfect. The information cards next to artworks seem specifically designed to make you feel like you skipped a few crucial years of art school, using words that sound made up but apparently aren't. And let's not even start on the unspoken hierarchy of who gets to sit on those precious few benches – it's like a game of musical chairs where nobody knows when the music stops.


The timing is always off too. You either spend way too long in front of something you don't particularly care about because someone important-looking is watching, or you rush past something amazing because a tour group is breathing down your neck. And heaven forbid you laugh at something that wasn't meant to be funny – the echoes of your inappropriate chuckle will haunt you for days.


So what would the perfect art space look like? Imagine a place where the pretense melts away like ice cream on a hot day, but the magic stays intact. We're talking about spaces that breathe with their visitors, where the lighting adapts to how people actually look at art (not just how curators think they should), and where comfortable seating isn't treated like an exotic concept. Picture rooms that encourage conversation without making whispers feel mandatory, where you can get close enough to really see the artwork without setting off silent alarms.


This dream space would have zones for different energy levels – quiet areas for those who want to commune with art in silence, and livelier spots where people can actually talk about what they're seeing without feeling like they're committing a cultural crime. The labels would be written by humans for humans, not academic papers masquerading as wall text. And maybe, just maybe, there'd be places where you could sketch or respond to the art you're seeing without feeling like you're breaking some unspoken rule.


The temperature would vary subtly throughout the space, creating natural transitions between areas and keeping people alert without freezing them into artistic appreciation. The floors would be comfortable enough for long visits but would still have that satisfying click of shoes that makes everyone feel a bit more sophisticated. And there'd be charging stations – because let's be honest, taking pictures and looking up artists drains your battery faster than a video call with bad reception.


Most importantly, this utopic space would somehow manage to maintain the sense of something special happening – that feeling that you're in a place where magical things might occur – while ditching the artificial barriers that keep so many people from feeling welcome. It would be a place where art feels less like a test you didn't study for and more like a conversation you can't wait to join.


The trick would be keeping that slight edge of the sacred without tipping over into pretension – like a cathedral that's also a comfortable living room. A space that remembers art isn't just about showing us beautiful or challenging things, but about giving us room to respond to them honestly, whether that response is a scholarly thesis or just a long "hmmmmm" while tilting your head to the side.



PIXELS


So here's a wild thought – what if we could take all those quirky, frustrating, wonderful things about art spaces and toss them into the digital blender? Not to replace our beloved temples of culture, mind you, but to create this parallel universe where the laws of physics are more like friendly suggestions and the only limit to exhibition space is your internet bandwidth.


Picture logging into a virtual gallery where you can choose your own adventure – want to be the silent observer? Cool, other visitors will see you as a subtle shimmer in the digital air. Feel like channeling your inner art critic? Flip a switch, and suddenly you're visible to others who want to debate whether that pixelated sculpture is a commentary on digital decay or just someone's forgotten download. It's like having an invisibility cloak with a toggle switch, perfect for those days when you can't decide if you're feeling social or spiritual.


These virtual spaces could do this neat trick where they exist in multiple states at once, like Schrödinger's gallery. The same room could be hosting a rowdy virtual opening night complete with digital champagne (zero calories, infinite refills) for one group, while another group experiences it as a zen garden of contemplation. Your friend in Tokyo could be seeing the same artwork in morning light while you're viewing it under a virtual sunset in New York, and somehow, you're both right.


The really clever bit would be how these spaces could shape-shift based on who's visiting. Imagine walking through a virtual MoMA where the architecture responds to crowd patterns like a living thing, expanding corridors when they're busy, creating intimate nooks when you need a moment with that one piece that speaks to your soul. The walls could become transparent when you're trying to find your friends, or turn into cosmic black holes of privacy when you're having an emotional moment with an artwork that just gets you.


And let's talk about those information cards – you know, the ones that currently make you feel like you need three PhDs just to understand why someone stuck a banana to a wall. In virtual space, these could be like choose-your-own-adventure stories. Want the five-year-old's version? Here's a fun explanation with animated characters. Need the deep dive? Dive into a rabbit hole of art history that makes Wikipedia look like a post-it note. Feeling poetic? Here's the artist's story told through interpretative dance by a virtual performer.


The social aspects could get really interesting too. Instead of awkwardly pretending not to notice other people taking selfies, you could literally tune into different social frequencies. Maybe you join the "serious art discussion" channel where avatars are discussing brush techniques in hushed tones, or hop over to the "first-time visitors" room where it's totally cool to say "I don't get it" without feeling like you've committed some sort of cultural crime.


These spaces could play with scale in ways that would make actual architects weep with joy (or possibly horror). Want to see how that tiny Vermeer would look if it were the size of a billboard? Go for it. Curious about how that massive installation would work as a miniature? Shrink it down and carry it in your virtual pocket. The art itself could break free from the tyranny of fixed dimensions, breathing and changing like a living thing.


Sound design could become its own art form here. Instead of the current gallery soundtrack of shuffling feet and whispered conversations, each piece could have its own acoustic space. That stormy seascape could actually sound like a tempest, but only when you're standing in front of it. The abstract expression piece might pulse with the rhythm of the artist's heartbeat as they created it. And yes, you could still have that one person who somehow manages to have their phone go off in a virtual space – some traditions are sacred.


The really revolutionary bit would be how these spaces could handle time. Miss an exhibition? No problem – just dial back the virtual calendar. Want to see how different artists from different centuries might have approached the same space? Toggle between time periods like you're channel surfing through art history. The space itself becomes a time machine, but without the awkward period costumes and gift shop merchandise.


And here's where it gets properly mind-bending – these spaces could exist in multiple cultural contexts simultaneously. That Renaissance masterpiece could be displayed with its original religious context for some visitors, while others explore its influence on contemporary pop culture. It's like having parallel universes of art appreciation all stacked on top of each other like a layer cake of perspective.


The possibilities for interaction go beyond just looking and chatting. Visitors could leave virtual traces – not graffiti, but thoughtful digital echoes. Maybe your emotional response to an artwork becomes a subtle color change in the space that only future visitors who feel the same way can see. It's like a mood ring for collective art appreciation, creating this invisible web of shared experiences across time and space.


Think about the accessibility angle too – suddenly, mobility issues, geographic location, and opening hours become non-issues. That friend who can never make it to exhibitions because they're taking care of kids? They could do a virtual gallery crawl at 3 AM while the little ones are asleep. The art student in rural anywhere could visit every major museum in the world between breakfast and lunch.


Here's the thing though – none of this is about replacing our beloved physical art spaces. It's more like adding new instruments to the orchestra of human experience. Sometimes you want the full sensory symphony of a real gallery visit, with its echoing floors and slightly judgmental security guards. Other times, you might want to explore art in your pajamas while floating through digital space like some sort of cultured ghost.


And maybe that's the real magic possibility here – not creating a better version of art spaces, but a different one that fills in the gaps we didn't even know we had. Like how radio didn't kill theater, and streaming didn't kill cinema, virtual art spaces might just open up new ways of experiencing creativity that we haven't even imagined yet. Because at the end of the day, art isn't just about the stuff we put in galleries – it's about the spaces between perception and understanding, between the artist's intent and the viewer's experience, between the real and the possible. And sometimes, those spaces might just happen to be made of pixels.

MUSEUMS
1. Taking two transfer buses to get there, leaving your coat at the cloakroom, buying a ticket and moving forward to scan it, or spending 15 minutes looking for a parking spot for your car, walking 3 minutes to enter, or in a city where you can walk everywhere in 10 minutes, approaching from an important historical square, feeling that proud weight building up as you wait in line for 15 minutes.

2. The urgency to smoke before entering and after exiting, since it's going to be a long adventure.

3. Open, airy, and colorless spaces, not imposing too much character but creating just enough void to let an artwork define itself in three dimensions.

4. Being a city landmark, sometimes standing apart, sometimes existing within the urban fabric, but always somehow shouting "yes, something different is here" among the regular order.

5. White-shirted, black-suited people constantly around, checking your ticket, or monitoring if you're being gentle with the paintings, not throwing tomatoes at them, but generally pacing around in a bored manner.

6. That moment when you accidentally catch someone else's audio guide snippets as they pass by, creating an oddly poetic mismatch with whatever you're looking at.

7. A guide speaking in some completely irrelevant language followed by 20 people over middle age wearing headphones.

8. The way everyone whispers even in the most crowded rooms, creating this constant soft murmur that sounds almost like waves.

9. The particular smell of old buildings mixed with fresh paint and air conditioning, especially strong near the contemporary exhibitions.

10. The way your footsteps sound different in each room, from echoing marble halls to hushed carpet galleries, making you suddenly self-conscious about how loudly you're walking.

11. Those small wooden stools that museum attendants occasionally sit on in corner spots, looking like they're part of the exhibition themselves.

12. That bar right in the middle of the promenade where you can have an espresso and quietly discuss what you've seen with your companions.

13. That white-haired woman in a purple sweater with interesting glasses, sitting for long periods on those backless uncomfortable chairs, fixated on a single painting.

14. Those gift shops at the end that feel like there must be some mafia controlling them, distributing the same souvenirs and art/design/architecture books everywhere, as if it's mandatory, not to forget those rather tacky black, red, and white t-shirts with the museum's name printed on them for 40 euros (Or notebooks, pens. Though they used to excite me at first, over the years I realized they're all the same. Anyone wanting to see Klimt's *The Kiss* printed on anything can visit any museum gift shop.)

15. People taking selfies in front of paintings, having friends take their photos, getting super close to capture details (I do all these too, especially when I see a Bacon or any famous Renaissance painting).

16. That specific tension when someone stands too close to a painting and the security guard shifts their weight ever so slightly, ready to intervene.

17. People reading long texts thoroughly, then quickly leaving the room (this is very funny).

18. Those who walk very slowly like flâneurs, never stopping but allowing themselves just enough time to see the work as they pass by.

19. In some prestigious museums, the way things are placed so close together creates both a thrift shop feeling and your own overwhelm trying to understand it all, and in the final rooms, how your walking speed and attention span become inversely proportional.

20. Sometimes the light being too tiring, creating glare on the artwork and reducing the quality of the experience (Foundation Beyeler's natural lighting was very beautiful).

21. Smiling elderly cool people and hippies walking around in hiking clothes.

22. Groups of art students sitting cross-legged on the floor with their sketchbooks, always somehow managing to block the exact piece you wanted to see.

23. The slight anxiety when your phone camera makes that loud shutter sound in a quiet gallery, even though photography is allowed.

24. Those moments when you accidentally activate a motion sensor for gallery lighting and suddenly feel like you're in a performance piece.

25. The peculiar dance of trying to read wall text while not blocking others' views, often ending in an awkward shuffle with strangers.

26. Perhaps slightly excited but tired tourists who came to the city and allocated time to visit that museum.

27. You can always trust the fact that they always have the cleanest toilets, with some fancy design, and they're marked as the safe spot in your city.

GALLERIES
1. Generally, painting a ground floor shop's walls white, installing single-piece glass or multiple glasses on the street facade, and writing random names in Helvetica or similar fonts (with -25 spacing) on these glasses.

2. Passing by them every time you walk down the street but finding it almost impossible to enter.

3. That slight panic when you push the door and it doesn't open immediately, making you wonder if they're actually closed despite the listed opening hours.

4. The way gallery assistants type with intense focus when you enter, pretending they haven't noticed you, giving you space to look around uncomfortably.

5. During normal times, maximum one person browsing inside, and they usually leave quickly.

6. At the very back of the space, sometimes at the entrance, a woman around 27 years old looking through her glasses at an iMac, always dressed in black or white, with stacks of papers invariably in front of her.

7. The fact that the few people working there, compared to museums, have much more knowledge about the exhibition, and if you can overcome your social anxiety and if the exhibition interests you a bit, you can have really nice conversations with them.

8. In smaller pop-up style temporary galleries, always having someone needy and eager to talk inside, but you, despite maybe being curious about the interior, seeing them and the works beside them, maybe wanting to enter a bit, but not entering just because of your social anxiety.

9. Those little paper stacks with artist statements printed in impossibly small font, sitting untouched on a minimal white plinth.

10. The precise 45-degree angle at which price lists are placed on the desk, never meant to be obviously visible but always somehow within eyeshot.

11. Those tiny dots next to artworks - red for sold, sometimes creating an immediate shift in how you view the piece.

12. The way every gallery seems to have that one chair that looks like art but might actually be for sitting, leaving you forever uncertain.

13. Abstract works so similar to each other that while you respect the artist, you wonder if it's all just a bubble.

14. The ritual of pretending to understand the curatorial text while nodding thoughtfully, even though it's written in the most abstract academic language possible.

15. The way contemporary galleries always seem to have that one massive piece that makes you wonder how they got it through the door.

16. The slight awkwardness when you realize the thing you thought was art is actually just a thermostat or fire alarm that happens to be at perfect gallery height.

17. That particular silence when you're alone in the gallery and the assistant takes a phone call, speaking in hushed tones about art world matters you can only half understand.

18. The specific tension when someone walks in with a coffee cup and everyone subtly watches them like hawks.

19. A strangely dressed person in their fifties quickly passing through with their designer dog, everyone standing at attention during this moment; those people usually appear from an invisible back door and exit through the main door, and the entire gallery staff's energy shifts from bored to extremely attentive in milliseconds.

20. The carefully curated playlist that's always just a bit too quiet to fully hear, usually ambient electronic music or minimal classical, creating an atmosphere of forced sophistication.

21. The ritual of gallery assistants adjusting spotlights multiple times a day, as if the sun's movement through the space is personally offending the artwork.

22. If you go to any exhibition opening, there's plenty of prosecco in Milan, crémant in Luxembourg, and red wine in Istanbul, all free, and people chatting in groups of 5 or 7 with finished wine glasses in their hands.

23. Gallery openings where everyone seems to know each other, creating little archipelagos of social groups that you have to navigate between.

24. Those tiny scuff marks on otherwise perfect white walls that everyone pretends not to see, until they're obsessively repainted between shows.

25. Those moments when you're trying to take a photo of an artwork and the gallerist suddenly appears, making you feel like you're doing something wrong even though it's allowed.

26. The way gallerists effortlessly glide from English to Italian to German during openings, while discussing the same artwork with different groups, making you wonder if art-speak is actually a universal language.

27. The slight disappointment when you realize the wine at the opening is actually prosecco-like sparkling wine from the local supermarket.

28. That specific moment during openings when someone who's clearly important arrives and everyone pretends not to notice while absolutely noticing.

29. The unspoken hierarchy of opening night glasses - some people mysteriously receiving actual glass while others get plastic cups.

30. The way price inquiries are always answered with "I'll have to check with the director" even when the director is clearly visible in the back office.

31. The performative aspect of installing a new window.
